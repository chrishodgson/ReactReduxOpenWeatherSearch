# ReactReduxWeatherSearch

A simple search screen that displays 5 day weather forecasts from Open Weather Map with Temperature, Pressure and 
Humidity charts along with a Google Map of the location.

## Getting Started

Setup your API key, checkout this repo, install dependencies, then start the webpack process with the following:

### Setting up your API Key

A default Open Weather Map API key is setup for this project. This should be changed by editing the `API_KEY` in `src/actions/index.js`.
You can register your own api key at the Open Weather Map site `https://openweathermap.org/api` 

### Installing

This assumes that `npm` is already installed. 

```
> git clone https://github.com/chrishodgson/ReactReduxWeatherSearch.git
> cd ReactReduxWeatherSearch
> npm install
> npm start
```


## Showing Weather Forecasts for a different country

By default, it will search for weather forecasts in the UK, but you can easily change this by editing the `COUNTRY_CODE` in `src/actions/index.js`.
You can find a list of the country codes at the Open Weather Map site by entering a city from that country  `https://openweathermap.org/city`
